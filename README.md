Mario Kart 64 Analytics Engine
-------------------------------

The repos in this organization are the culmination of 2 semesters of work on
a Boston University senior design project. Our goal was to create a system
that would procoess recordings of Mario Kart 64 for interesting events and
then allow one to go back and get insights into what happened in aggregate. In
this way interesting game insights, fun replays, and bragging rights can all
be realized.

This repository contains some of the documentation and reports that went into
the project.
